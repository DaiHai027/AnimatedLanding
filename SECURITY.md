# Security Policy

## Security Audit Approach

This project implements a layered security audit strategy to balance security with practical development needs.

### 🔒 Production Security (Critical)

**Policy**: Zero tolerance for high/critical vulnerabilities in production dependencies.

```bash
# Production audit (must pass)
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

**Status**: ✅ **0 vulnerabilities** in production dependencies

### 🛠️ Development Security (Monitored)

**Policy**: Moderate vulnerabilities acceptable in development dependencies if:
- They don't affect production builds
- They are in build tools/testing frameworks
- No high/critical vulnerabilities exist

**Current Status**: 11 moderate vulnerabilities in development dependencies
- **Affected**: esbuild, vite, drizzle-kit, vitest (development tools only)
- **Issue**: esbuild development server request vulnerability
- **Impact**: None on production builds
- **Mitigation**: Development server not used in production

### 🚨 Current Vulnerabilities

#### Moderate Severity (Development Only)
- **esbuild**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
  - **Description**: Development server can receive requests from any website
  - **Affected Packages**: esbuild, vite, drizzle-kit, vitest
  - **Production Impact**: None (development server not used in production)
  - **Status**: Monitoring for fix from maintainers

### 🔄 Audit Schedule

#### Continuous Integration
- **Production Dependencies**: Audited on every PR/push (fail on high/critical)
- **Development Dependencies**: Audited and reported (warn on moderate)

#### Manual Audits
```bash
# Full security audit
npm audit

# Production-only audit
npm audit --omit=dev

# High/critical only
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Check for updates
npm outdated
```

### 📝 Security Review Process

#### For New Dependencies
1. Run security audit before adding
2. Review dependency source and maintainer reputation
3. Prefer well-maintained packages with active security updates
4. Document any accepted risks

#### For Existing Vulnerabilities
1. Monitor security advisories
2. Update dependencies when fixes available
3. Evaluate impact vs. stability trade-offs
4. Document decisions in this file

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

#### Development
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use `npm audit` before major releases
- Review security advisories for critical dependencies
- Use `.npmrc` for registry security settings

#### Production
- Run production-only audits in CI/CD
- Use specific dependency versions (no `^` or `~`)
- Implement proper environment variable handling
- Use Docker security scanning for containers

#### CI/CD
- Separate production and development security checks
- Fail builds on high/critical production vulnerabilities
- Monitor and report development vulnerabilities
- Use signed commits and protected branches

### 📊 Security Metrics

#### Current Status
- **Production Vulnerabilities**: 0 high/critical ✅
- **Development Vulnerabilities**: 11 moderate ⚠️
- **Security Audit**: Passing ✅
- **Last Updated**: 2024-01-15

#### Targets
- **Production**: 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Development**: < 20 moderate vulnerabilities
- **Response Time**: < 7 days for critical fixes
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly dependency reviews

### 🔧 Security Tools

#### Automated
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CI/CD Security**: Automated checks in workflows

#### Manual
- **Security Reviews**: Code review for security implications
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular manual updates for major versions
- **Security Testing**: Manual testing of authentication/authorization

### 📞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [project maintainer email]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure
